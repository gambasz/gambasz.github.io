# Analyzing Donald Trump's Tweets and the Stock Market
In this Data Science tutorial written in Python, I showed how one might approach the Data Science Pipeline using various libraries and methods.

I set out to see if one could've predicted the price of stocks by analyzing Trump's twitter archive, in order to determine whether there was a correlation and/or causation effect between Trump's positive or negative comments about a company and the price of its stock.

The full tutorial along with its results can be found [here](https://gambasz.github.io/trumptweets)!
