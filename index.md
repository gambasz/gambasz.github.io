# Analyzing Donald Trump's Tweets and the Stock Market
In this Data Science tutorial written in Python, I showed how one might approach the Data Science Pipeline using various libraries and methods.

I set out to see if one could've predicted the price of stocks by analyzing Trump's twitter archive, in order to determine whether there was a correlation and/or causation effect between Trump's positive or negative comments about a company and the price of its stock.

The full tutorial along with its results can be found [here](https://gambasz.github.io/trumptweets)!

# Parser and Interpreter for microCaml
As a Teacher Assistant for Organization of Programming Languages, at the University of Maryland, I along with fellow TAs wrote a parser and interpreter for a small subset of the OCaml language (microCaml) that was used to teach students about recursive descent parsing and evaluators. The work done for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/anwarmamat/cmsc330fall21/tree/main/project4a)!

# Cracking Secret-Sharing
As part of a team with Dr. William Gasarch at the University of Maryland, I implemented and cracked secret sharing protocols, as well as resarching which protocols are ideal and non-ideal. This work can be found [here!](https://gambasz.github.io/idealsecretsharing.pdf)
